            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was an expansion to Elden Ring released as downloadable
                content (DLC) in 2024. Despite its classification as an expansion, it was nominated for 
                Game of the Year the year of its release. The expansion included an entirely new open world
                map, several new armament types, new items, armaments, and armor sets, a slew of new Characters,
                bosses, and sidequests, and of course, a new main story. As has become traditional for expansions to 
                FromSoftware's other Souldborne games, Shadow of the Erdtree quickly developed a reputaion as being 
                an extremely difficult video game.

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>The main story of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree starts off with the player's defeat
                of one of the base game's bosses, at which point a new NPC recruits the player for a quest.
                Though this quest eventually goes sideways, the player uncovers and thwarts an insidious plot 
                by which one of the queen's demigod children rejects the quest to be Elden Lord and instead 
                attempts to ascend to godhood.

            <h2>Lore</h2>
            <p>The DLC also expands significantly upon the lore provided in the base game. The player
                is offered the chance to learn about a secret child of the queen who bears a curse and 
                was banished to another land. The story of an old, secret war comes to light, and the 
                diligent player even learn's about the queen's own personal history and her path to godhood. 
                Further, the player may even uncover evidence of a terrible secret regarding an even greater 
                power believed to be watching over The Lands Between.
