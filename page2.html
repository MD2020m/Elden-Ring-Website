                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was an expansion to Elden Ring released as downloadable
                    content (DLC) in 2024. Despite its classification as an expansion, it was nominated for 
                    Game of the Year the year of its release. The expansion included an entirely new open world
                    map, several new armament types, new items, armaments, and armor sets, a slew of new Characters,
                    bosses, and sidequests, and of course, a new main story. As has become traditional for expansions to 
                    FromSoftware's other Souldborne games, Shadow of the Erdtree quickly developed a reputaion as being 
                    an extremely difficult video game.

                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>The main story of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree starts off with the player's defeat
                    of one of the base game's bosses, at which point a new NPC recruits the player for a quest.
                    Though this quest eventually goes sideways, the player uncovers and thwarts an insidious plot 
                    by which one of the queen's demigod children rejects the quest to be Elden Lord and instead 
                    attempts to ascend to godhood.

                <h2>Lore</h2>
                <p>The DLC also expands significantly upon the lore provided in the base game. The player
                    is offered the chance to learn about a secret child of the queen who bears a curse and 
                    was banished to another land. The story of an old, secret war comes to light, and the 
                    diligent player even learn's about the queen's own personal history and her path to godhood. 
                    Further, the player may even uncover evidence of a terrible secret regarding an even greater 
                    power believed to be watching over The Lands Between.
