                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Elden Ring is a Soulsborne video game developed by FromSoftware and
                    released in 2022. The game won Game of the Year the year of its release.
                    Like most of FromSoftware's Soulsborne games, Elden Ring's development
                    was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, who also directed Dark Souls, Bloodborne, 
                    and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Elden Ring is the first Soulsborne game to 
                    feature a true open world map. Also of note, 'Game of Thrones' author, George R.R.
                    Martin, was involved in the game's development.

                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>The main storyline, which the player experiences directly
                    as they make their way through the game, begins with a short expository cutscene.
                    The cutscene explains that the queen and goddess of The Lands Between, the world 
                    in which the game is set, has broken a mysterious object known as the Elden Ring. 
                    This caused a war between demigods known as the Shattering, in which each of
                    the queen's children fought to claim broken pieces of the Elden Ring in order
                    to repair it, thus claiming a powerful seat as Elden Lord. This war bore no victor,
                    and so a power even greater than the queen called upon members of a group known as the 
                    tarnished to seek the pieces of the Elden Ring and claim the seat of Elden Lord. The 
                    player's character is one of these tarnished, and the game allows the player to 
                    participate in their character's journey to become the Elden Lord.

                <h2>Lore</h2>
                <p>In true Soulsborne fashion, the true depth of the game's world
                    is not immediately apparent. Rather, a great deal of lore is hidden
                    within the game's sparse dialog, much of which can only be heard upon 
                    completing various steps of the game's opaque sidequests, as well as
                    in a number of the descriptions attached to the game's many (very very many)
                    items.

                    <br><br>
                    By compiling these bits and pieces, the diligent player can piece together a more
                    complete understanding of the game's world. Details about the Shattering's many battles, 
                    a plot which resulted in the death of one of the queen's children, pre-shattering history
                    of The Lands Between, the origin of the tarnished, and more can all be uncovered by careful
                    sleuthing through the game's many caves, catacombs, and hidden chambers. This laborious process
                    of experiencing the full depth of the game's story is a hallmark of FromSoftware's 
                    Soulsborne titles and one of the many reasons for the developer's cult following.
